# Is Mu-An asleep?

Mu-An lives many timezones away and sometimes I talk to her and she doesn't
answer and it's because she's asleep. Now you too can know when she's asleep.

Also I really wanted to make an Electron app.

## Running this locally

```
$ git clone https://github.com/notwaldorf/is-mu-an-asleep
$ cd is-mu-an-asleep
$ npm install
$ npm run app
```
